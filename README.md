This repository wraps the OpenStax
[osbooks-college-physics-bundle](https://github.com/openstax/osbooks-college-physics-bundle)
CNXML source (a fork living in the [`source/`](./source) submodule, pinned at
the `QuadriviumPress/osbooks-college-physics-bundle` fork) and adds an
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) build that renders _College Physics 2e_ and
_College Physics for AP® Courses 2e_ (566 pages from 318 modules) as a
browsable, installable web site.
The submodule is the only place content (`source/collections/`,
`source/modules/`, `source/media/`) lives and it is **never modified** here —
all transformation happens at build time, so pulling upstream errata is a clean
submodule bump.

## Features

- Two-book site with a collapsible sidebar, prev/next navigation, and
  client-side full-text search (self-hosted [MiniSearch](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/))
- Build-generated, chapter-scoped numbering of figures, tables, equations,
  examples, and Check Your Understanding boxes, matching openstax.org
  (shared modules are renumbered per book)
- Math rendered from the source MathML by fully self-hosted **MathJax v4**
  (script *and* `mathjax-newcm` fonts — no CDN requests)
- **Progressive Web App**: installable (web manifest + icons) with a service
  worker that precaches the app shell and serves visited pages, images, and
  math fonts offline
- `<link rel="canonical">` on the 248 duplicated pages (modules shared by both
  books) pointing at the College Physics 2e copy
- Post-build verification (`npm run verify`): page counts, link/fragment
  integrity, media existence, numbering sequences, canonical links, zero CNXML
  leakage

## Building

```bash
# first-time: initialize the source/ submodule (or clone with --recursive)
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm ci
npm run update:vendor   # copy self-hosted MathJax (+fonts) and MiniSearch into assets/
npm run build           # build _site/ + search index
npm run serve           # dev server at http://localhost:4000/college-physics-bundle/
npm test                # unit tests over lib/ (no submodule or build needed)
npm run lint            # eslint
npm run verify          # post-build checks over _site/
```

Requires Node ≥ 22. See [BUILDING.md](./BUILDING.md) for architecture,
deployment (GitHub Pages / Vercel), and gotchas.

## Updating the OpenStax source

The textbook content is tracked as the `source/` submodule pointing at the
`QuadriviumPress/osbooks-college-physics-bundle` fork of OpenStax. To pull new
upstream errata:

```bash
# 1. (in the fork) sync it with openstax upstream, push to QuadriviumPress/...
# 2. (here) bump the submodule pointer to the fork's latest commit:
cd source && git fetch origin && git checkout origin/main && cd ..
git add source
git commit -m "bump openstax source: <errata>"
```

This records a single submodule-SHA change rather than replaying upstream
history into this repo.

## Continuous integration

- [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — on pull requests: full build +
  `npm run verify`
- [`deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) — on pushes to `main`: build,
  verify, and deploy to GitHub Pages
